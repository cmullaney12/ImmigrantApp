# ImmigrantApp
A small Django application that allows the user to search through records of immigrants and insert, update, and delete records.

The main page of our application shows the list of immigrant records. 
  * To __filter__ this list, select values from the drop down boxes and click 'Filter'.
  * To __delete__ or __edit__ an entry from this list, select the corresponding option in the 'Actions' column.
  * To __add__ a new entry to the database, click the 'Create' button and select values for each field.
